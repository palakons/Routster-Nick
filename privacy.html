                <h2>Privacy&nbsp;Policy</h2>
                <p class="statement">Your privacy is critically important to us. At longwarp.com, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask
                        you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
                    <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products,
                        or protect our rights.</li>
                    <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of
                        our services.</li>
                    <li>In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to
                        the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Below is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals.
                </p>

                <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
                <p>Like most website operators, longwarp.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
                    web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring
                    site, and the date and time of each visitor request. longwarp.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally
                    identifying information is to better understand how longwarp.com’s visitors use its website. From time
                    to time, longwarp.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing
                    a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <p>longwarp.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
                    for logged in users and for users leaving comments on WordPress.com blogs. longwarp.com only discloses
                    logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
                    information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible
                    and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
                <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <p>Certain visitors to longwarp.com’s websites choose to interact with longwarp.com in ways that require longwarp.com
                    to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that longwarp.com gathers
                    depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>                    to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with longwarp.com – by purchasing
                    access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional
                    information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those
                    transactions. In each case, longwarp.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate
                    to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with longwarp.com. longwarp.com does not disclose personally-identifying
                    information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying
                    information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
                <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
                <p>longwarp.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, longwarp.com
                    may monitor the most popular blogs on the WordPress.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service
                    to help identify spam. longwarp.com may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However,
                    longwarp.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
                <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <p>longwarp.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those
                    of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in
                    order to process it on longwarp.com’s behalf or to provide services available at longwarp.com’s websites,
                    and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated
                    organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using longwarp.com’s websites, you consent
                    to the transfer of such information to them. longwarp.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying
                    and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
                    organizations, as described above, longwarp.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                    information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when longwarp.com
                    believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of longwarp.com,
                    third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an longwarp.com website and have
                    supplied your email address, longwarp.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features,
                    solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with longwarp.com and our products.
                    We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep
                    this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one
                    of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond
                    to your request or to help us support other users. longwarp.com takes all measures reasonably necessary
                    to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying
                    and personally-identifying information.</p>
                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s
                    browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. longwarp.com uses cookies to help longwarp.com
                    identify and track visitors, their usage of longwarp.com website, and their website access preferences.
                    longwarp.com visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers
                    to refuse cookies before using longwarp.com’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of longwarp.com’s
                    websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
                <p>If longwarp.com, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that longwarp.com
                    goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred
                    or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of
                    longwarp.com may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
                <h3>Ads</h3>
                <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                    These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement
                    to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks
                    to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to
                    you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by longwarp.com and does not cover the use of cookies
                    by any advertisers.</p>
                <h3>Comments</h3>
                <p>Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless
                    they were marked as false positives or missed spam, in which case we store them long enough to use them
                    to improve the service to avoid future false positives and missed spam.</p>
                <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, longwarp.com may change its Privacy Policy from time to time,
                    and in longwarp.com’s sole discretion. longwarp.com encourages visitors to frequently check this page for
                    any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s
                    dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
                    Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
